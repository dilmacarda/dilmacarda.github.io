        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>
          Style & Trend was created with one simple goal: make modern pieces that feel premium,
          look clean, and stay easy to wear every day. We focus on silhouettes that work in real life —
          not over-designed items that only look good in photos.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;">
          Our collections are built around three main moods: Streetwear, Luxury, and Casual.
          Streetwear gives you relaxed fits, bold comfort, and that “effortless” vibe. Luxury is about
          refined details — better finishing, sharper structure, and timeless color choices. Casual is the
          backbone: everyday pieces that you can style quickly without thinking too much.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;">
          We also keep our drops focused. Instead of uploading hundreds of products, we prefer fewer
          pieces that work together as a small wardrobe. This makes it easier to mix items, build outfits,
          and upgrade your style without wasting money on things you won’t wear.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;">
          If you ever need sizing help, product questions, or want to collaborate, you can reach us from
          the Contact page. We reply as fast as we can and always try to help with honest recommendations.
